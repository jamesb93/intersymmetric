        <p>The workshop will focus on an exploration of a new online music platform, where people interact together in real time, using pattern generating procedures and digital synthesis. As an inclusive project we want to work with people of different backgrounds, age groups, and abilities. It is open to participants with varying levels of musical expertise, including people with no previous experience and additional needs. The workshop consists of two separate sessions, each of which is 90 minutes long. Workshop dates will be agreed with selected participants. Participants will need access to a computer and a stable internet connection.</p>
