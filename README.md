# intersymmetric

This repo contains the frontend interface for intersymmetric works, a collaborative project with [Mark Fell]() and [Rian Treanor](). The frontend interface communicates with a socket.io server hosted elsewhere to create a real-time, interactive sequencer with support for an arbitrary number of rooms.

Big thanks to [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io) for the synthesis, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) for the frontend framework and [socket.io](https://socket.io) for the communication protocol.
